question1: values added:  20
question2: final result:  20
question3: values added:  20
question4: the code will have an error as the variable result is only defined in the scope of the if block.
question5: will result in an error as the variable result is declared as a constant when assigned to 0, thus reassigning it to sum1 + sum2 causes an error.
questoin6: the code will result in an error for the same reason as question 5.
